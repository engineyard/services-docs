h1. Creating an Engine Yard Add-on

Steps to obtain an Add-on partner Engine Yard account.

# Sign up for an Engine Yard Cloud account at "http://cloud.engineyard.com/":http://cloud.engineyard.com/.  A trial account is fine.
# Email your contact at Engine Yard with the following information:
** The email you used to sign up
** The name you want to use for your partner account. (Internal use only, not visible to Customers.)
# Your Engine Yard contact will then upgrade your Cloud accout to an Add-on partner account
** You will now have access to the Add-on partner portal: "https://services.engineyard.com":https://services.engineyard.com

This Add-on Partner portal provides you with the information you need to register and develop Add-on services.  After you have registered an Add-on service, you can use the UI from "https://services.engineyard.com":https://services.engineyard.com to activate the Add-on in a private test-mode that will only be available to Engine Yard Cloud account that you created in Step 1.
