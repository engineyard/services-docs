#Customer Account E-mails from the Add-on Partner API

The Add-ons e-mail API is now released for production use.

The challenge with simply providing an e-mail to the Add-on partner is that the Engione Yard account e-mails can change over time.  We solve this with notifications.  Thus, we will only send you e-mail address if you have implemented support for notifications.

In summary, you will need to: 

* Provide a "users_url" on account setup and respond to authenticated GETs to that URL with the format EY expects.
* Include in the users_url response the current e-mail and a "url" to which we can PUT updated for EACH user.
* Support PUT requests to the url returned in #2 and properly update your records.

To support notifications, send a "users_url" along with your response to service account creation.
Example:

    ApiHMAC -> POST (http://mock.service/api/1/service_accounts_callback)
    -> service_provider
    {"name"=>"some-account",
     "url"=>
      "http://services.engineyard.com/api/1/partners/20/services/21/service_accounts/23",
     "messages_url"=>
      "http://services.engineyard.com/api/1/partners/20/services/21/service_accounts/23/messages",
     "invoices_url"=>
      "http://services.engineyard.com/api/1/partners/20/services/21/service_accounts/23/invoices"}

    ApiHMAC <--200-- service_provider
    {"service_account"=>
      {"url"=>"http://mock.service/api/1/account/123",
       "configuration_required"=>false,
       "configuration_url"=>"http://mock.service/sso/account/123",
       "provisioned_services_url"=>
        "http://mock.service/api/1/account/123/provisioned_services_callback",
       "users_url"=>"http://mock.service/api/1/accounts/123/users"},
     "message"=>
      {"message_type"=>"status", "subject"=>"some messages", "body"=>nil}}

Notice that the returned JSON includes a "users_url" specific to the account that was created.  Now Engine Yard has a URL it can use to post updates if any information about the users on that account changes.

When the User then SSO's to the parter addon, the e-mail will be included. For example:

    ApiHMAC -> GET (http://mock.service/sso/account/123?access_level=owner&ey_return_to_url=https%3A%2F%2Fcloud.engineyard.com%2Fdashboard&ey_user_email=the-one-user%40example.com&ey_user_id=2164740220&ey_user_name=Person+Name&timestamp=2012-05-11T11%3A23%3A52-07%3A00&signature=AuthHMAC+123edf%3A8AuxfLpndgtIojrwmTBYoARXs1I%3D)
    -> service_provider
    ApiHMAC <--200-- service_provider

The partner gets the email along with id and name and can save this info.

When/If the user changes their e-mail address, we will make a GET request to the users_url we have for the Add-on, and determine if that update needs to be propagated to the Add-on.  For example:

    ApiHMAC -> GET (http://mock.service/api/1/accounts/123/users) ->
    service_provider
    ApiHMAC <--200-- service_provider
    [{"user"=>
       {"access_level"=>"owner",
        "ey_user_id"=>"2164740220",
        "ey_user_email"=>"the-one-user@example.com",
        "ey_user_name"=>"Person Name"},
      "url"=>"http://mock.service/api/1/accounts/123/users/2164740220"}]

We see all the information the partner has saved.  In this case, it included a different e-mail, so we make a PUT request to change it.

    ApiHMAC -> PUT (http://mock.service/api/1/accounts/123/users/2164740220)
    -> service_provider
    {"user"=>{"ey_user_email"=>"new_email@example.com"}}

    ApiHMAC <--200-- service_provider
    {}
